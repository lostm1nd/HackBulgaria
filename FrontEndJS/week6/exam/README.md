# Second Exam

You have to solve all 3 problems, that are located in the corresponding folders.

You can use everything you want :)

## Quick tips

* If you are going to use `node`, be sure to include `package.json` and not to include `node_modules` in the repository.
* For `bower` it is the same - include `bower.json` and do not include `bower_componetns`
* [__Handlebars__](http://handlebarsjs.com/) and [__lodash__](http://lodash.com/) are your friends! Use them.
* For the canvas problem, be sure to check the [__Canvas Cheatsheet__](http://cheatsheetworld.com/programming/html5-canvas-cheat-sheet/)

Good luck!
