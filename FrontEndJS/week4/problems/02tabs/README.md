# JavaScript Tabs

Implement tabs functionality, using JavaScript.

We have prepared for you `index.html` and `styles.css`.

The JavaScript is your job!

You have to implement something that looks like this - http://jqueryui.com/tabs/

## Requirements

* Each tab has its own content. For example, the tab that links to `#tab1` shoul display this div:

```html
<div id='tab1'>
    <p>Hi, this is the first tab.</p>
</div>
```

* __At any given time, there should be only 1 tab selected__ and the content for that tab - displayed
* __If the user clicks on different tab__, hide the content for the current tab and display the content for the newly selected tab.
* __Give some visual distinction for the selected tab.__ For example, the button can be different color.
