# JavaScript Gallery with Google Image Search

You have to implement a simple gallery, which display one image at a time and you can change images by clicking on the left or right arrows.

But there is a little twist! You have to load images from a Google Image Search!

## Requirements

* When the user enters a search query into the input and clicks the search button, load images from a google image search results.

* The user can change the images by clicking on the left or right button - tthis will change the current image

To do the Google Image Search, you can check their API for that - https://developers.google.com/image-search/v1/devguide

The problem is tricky so pay attention and give it a thought!
