# Refactoring with RequireJS and Promises

Now, it is time to revisit old projects and make them well-structured.

We have 2 of the 3 might weapons that can help us code better (RequireJS / Promises / Model-View-Whatever)

* Refactor the [Students-CRUD system](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Frontend-JavaScript-1/tree/master/week4/6-Students-CRUD) - modularize it and make the AJAX calls with promises (Q)
* Make a Game Lobby UI for the [Multiplayer games from week6](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Frontend-JavaScript-1/tree/master/week6) - Make the UI unspecific of the game so you can reuse it with all the games.

Use Promises and RequireJS!
