# Tic Tac Toe game

You are going to finish the implementation of a simple tic-tac-toe game.
The game will be console based.

You can open `game.js` to inspect the already written code that handles the printing of the board and the game loop.

You have to finish the following things:

* When started, the game should ask for nicknames for player 1 (X) and player 2 (O)
* The game should prompt the users in the correct order - first player 1, then player 2, etc.
* Players should enter the desired placement position by giving to numbers.

For example:
```
>1 1
```
__For the players, the upper-left corner of the board is with coordinates (1,1).__

* The game should check if the move is valid
* The game should check if one of the players is winning or the game has ended (No more moves available)


To implement the game, you will need basic JavaScript knowledge.
The code that is already in the game, shows the main structures of JavaScript.

You wont need anything else to finish the game.

## How to start the game

You will need all files from the directory:

* `.jshintrc`
* `package.json`
* `game.js`

In order to get the `sync-prompt` library, you need to run `npm install` in the tic-tac-toe directory.

It may need superuser.
