# Functional programming - week 6

[Day 1](./README.md#day-1)

[Day 2](./README.md#day-2)
 
## Day 1

### Continuing our `Functor` and `Applicative` journey!

#### Let's recall our typeclasses!
* `Functor`
```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

(<$>) :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
(<$>) = fmap
```
* `Applicative`
```haskell
class Functor f => Applicative f where
  pure  :: a -> f a
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

  -- These had a default implementation
  (<*) :: f a -> f b -> f a
  (*>) :: f a -> f b -> f b
```
* `Alternative`
```haskell
class Applicative f => Alternative f where
  empty :: f a
  (<|>) :: f a -> f a -> f a
```

So, all these typeclasses give us abstractions.

#### `kind`s

`In type theory, a kind is the type of a type constructor...`

```
> :kind Int
Int :: *
> :kind Maybe
Maybe :: * -> *
> :kind Maybe Int
Maybe Int :: *
```

`In order to create the instance `Functor T`, `T`'s kind must be `(* -> *)`

#### The Parser:
* The `Functor` instance allowsg to `fmap` a function on the result of the parser
* The `Applicative` instance allows to chain parsers when the first parser depends on the result of the second one
* The `Alternative` instance allows to pick a parser when there are several possible ways to parse

Now go to the [tasks](../week5/2-Applicatives/README.md#03-simple-parser) again!

## Day 2

First, let's finish our Statement parser!
[go here](./1-Applicatives/README.md#01-an-expression-parser)

### Dug a little (tiny) deeper.. Monads!
```haskell
class Monad m where
  return :: a -> m a
  (>>=)  :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b

  (>>) :: m a -> m b -> m b
  f >> g = f >>= \_ -> g
```

#### Take a look at some instances:
* The `Maybe` monad
* The `List` monad
* The `IO` monad

Let's do some [monad work](./2-Monads/README.md#01-instances) now!
