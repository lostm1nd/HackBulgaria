Functional Programming with Haskell

## Course Program

This is a draft program. It can change.

* Introduction to Functional Programming & the Haskell language. Basic concepts & syntax. Pure functions and immutability.
* Starting out with functions, type signatures & solving problems with recursion. Difference between types and typeclasses.
* `(x:xs)` - Lists & Problems with lists. Pattern matching.
* Higher order functions - the complete package. maps, filters and folds.
* Currying, Partial function applications & function composition. `(.)` and `($)`.
* Haskell's type inference & lazy evaluation - examples. Strictness & Non-Strictness
* Making our own types & typeclasses.
* Input / Output & making some console tools with Haskell.
* Introduction to Haskell's real world tools - Cabal. How to install 3rd party libraries & make projects.
* Consuming HTTP & parsing / crawling websites with `wreq` and `tagsoup`
* Making simple HTTP servers with [Scotty](https://github.com/scotty-web/scotty) or [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/)
* Looking things from the abtract point of view - starting with the typeclasses for Functors and Applicative Functors.
* Raising up the abstraction level - Associative binary functions, identities and monoids. 
* `return` does not return what you think it returns! Hello Monadic World.
* Looking back to the libraries we have used with the newly aquired knowledge. How are they implemented? Can we do it ourselves?
